              "description": "Apply a Wide Variety of Design Processes to a Wide Category of Design Problems Design of Biomedical Devices and Systems, Third Edition continues to provide a real-world approach to the design of biomedical engineering devices and/or systems. Bringing together information on the design and initiation of design projects from several sources, this edition strongly emphasizes and further clarifies the standards of design procedure. Following the best practices for conducting and completing a design project, it outlines the various steps in the design process in a basic, flexible, and logical order. What’s New in the Third Edition: This latest edition contains a new chapter on biological engineering design, a new chapter on the FDA regulations for items other than devices such as drugs, new end-of-chapter problems, new case studies, and a chapter on product development. It adds mathematical modeling tools, and provides new information on FDA regulations and standards, as well as clinical trials and sterilization methods. Familiarizes the reader with medical devices, and their design, regulation, and use Considers safety aspects of the devices Contains an enhanced pedagogy Provides an overview of basic design issues Design of Biomedical Devices and Systems, Third Edition covers the design of biomedical engineering devices and/or systems, and is designed to support bioengineering and biomedical engineering students and novice engineers entering the medical device market.",

Fresh from their adventures in a world inspired by Jules Verne, Shawna Keys and Karl Yatsar find themselves in a world that mirrors much darker tales. Beneath a full moon that hangs motionless in the sky, they’re forced to flee terrifying creatures that can only be vampires…only to run straight into a pack of werewolves. As the lycanthropes and undead battle, Karl is spirited away to the castle of the vampire queen. Meanwhile, Shawna finds short-lived refuge in a fortified village, where she learns that something has gone horribly wrong with the world in which she finds herself. Once, werewolves, vampires, and humans lived there harmoniously. Now every group is set against every other, and entire villages are being mysteriously emptied of people. Somehow, Karl and Shawna must reunite, discover the mysteries of the Shaping of this strange world, and escape it for the next, without being sucked dry, devoured, or—worst of all—turned into creatures of the night themselves. Beneath the frozen, gibbous moon, allies, enemies, surprises, adventures, and unsettling revelations await.",

The number one threat to our nation’s security is in cyberspace. The new US president wants to tackle the urgent problem head-on and launches a top secret line of defense: Net Force. But before the organization can be announced, the country is hit by an unprecedented, two-pronged terror attack. Not yet empowered by Congress nor embraced by a dubious intelligence community, still untested, unproven and officially unnamed, Net Force’s elite group of cyber experts and field operatives must lead the fight against the ongoing waves of hacks while tracking down the mastermind. Their failure could mean global catastrophe. Success may lead them to become the highest-level security agency in the United States. A story that seems ripped from tomorrow’s headlines, Net Force: Dark Web relaunches one of the most prescient thriller series at a time when cybersecurity is more vital than ever.",

Looking for answers to this holocaust--and disturbed by her macabre longing for connection to the Water Twins--Kyo is led to the diary of a limnologist from the time just prior to the destruction. This gritty memoir describes a near-future Toronto in the grips of severe water scarcity during a time when China owns the USA and the USA owns Canada. The diary spans a twenty-year period in the mid-twenty-first century of 33-year-old Lynna, a single mother who works in Toronto for CanadaCorp, an international utility that controls everything about water, and who witnesses disturbing events that she doesn't realize will soon lead to humanity's demise. A Diary in the Age of Water follows the climate-induced journey of Earth and humanity through four generations of women, each with a unique relationship to water. The novel explores identify and our concept of what is \"normal\"--as a nation and an individual--in a world that is rapidly and incomprehensibly changing.",
